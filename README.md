minesweeper
===========

Basic minesweeper game made for a coding challenge.

You have the ability to choose the size of the map as well as your own difficult by adjusting the maximum number of mines to be randomly dispersed.
Once you you're sure you've found all elements of the map not including bombs, you can hit validate to check your answer.
A cheat button on the side allows you to view the solution and end the game right away.
